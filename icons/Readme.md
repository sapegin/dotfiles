# Icons

## Recommended apps

- Code: code editors (Visual Studio Code, etc.)
- Floppy: file managers (Nimble Commander, ForkLift, etc.)
- Internet, Netscape: browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Kurush: mail clients (Outlook, Fastmail, etc.)
- Raven: personal chat apps (Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Sunset: note taking apps (Obsidian, Notion, etc.)
- Udav: work chats (Slack, Teams, etc.)

I recommend [Replacicon](https://replacicon.app/) to replace Mac icons.
