# Creating Toast Notifications

Toast notifications are transient status messages. Unlike menus, they should not close when a user interacts with other parts of the page. The popover="manual" state is ideal because it lacks "light-dismiss" behavior and allows multiple notifications to coexist.

### Implementation Guidelines

* **MANDATORY:** Use popover="manual" so the notification stays visible until explicitly closed or timed out by a script.
* **DO** use a container to manage the stacking of multiple toasts. Since popovers in the Top Layer ignore parent z-index, you must position them individually or within a common layout group.
* **DO** use sibling-index() to add margin between toast notifications so that items lower in the stack are visible.
* **DO** provide an explicit "Close" button within the toast using popovertargetaction="hide".
* **DO** use JavaScript for auto-dismissal timers (e.g., calling hidePopover() after 3000ms).
* **DO** utilize transition-behavior: allow-discrete to animate the entry and exit from the Top Layer.

### Fallback Strategies

### Fallbacks & browser support for Popover

Baseline status for Popover: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2025-01-27.
Supported by: Chrome 116 (Aug 2023), Edge 116 (Aug 2023), Firefox 125 (Apr 2024), Safari 17 (Sep 2023), and Safari iOS 18.3 (Jan 2025).

The Popover API is mostly **progressive enhancement**, but its defining behaviors — top-layer promotion, light-dismiss, and `popovertarget` invocation — have no CSS-only equivalent. Older browsers need a polyfill, or a manual fallback if you would rather not ship one.

**Polyfill:** To support the `popover` attribute in older browsers, conditionally load [`@oddbird/popover-polyfill`](https://github.com/oddbird/popover-polyfill). **MANDATORY:** Feature detect by checking for the `popover` property on `HTMLElement.prototype`, and load the polyfill **only** when native support is missing — do NOT load it unconditionally.

With a bundler or import map:

```js
// MANDATORY: Feature detect 'popover' on HTMLElement.prototype.
if (!("popover" in HTMLElement.prototype)) {
  import("@oddbird/popover-polyfill");
}
```

Without a bundler, import from a CDN inside a `<script type="module">`:

```html
<script type="module">
  if (!("popover" in HTMLElement.prototype)) {
    import("https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/popover-polyfill@latest/dist/popover.min.js");
  }
</script>
```

**Styling caveat:** The polyfill cannot define the real `:popover-open` pseudo-class, so it applies a `.\:popover-open` class instead. **MANDATORY:** Combine the two with `:is()` or `:where()`, otherwise browsers that lack `:popover-open` discard the entire rule:

```css
[popover]:is(:popover-open, .\:popover-open) {
  display: block;
}
```

Alternatively, for a legacy fallback without a polyfill, use `position: fixed` and manually calculate coordinates via `getBoundingClientRect()` or rely on default positioning with `inset: auto` if that's acceptable for the use case.

#### sibling-index()

* **Guidance:** If sibling-index() is not supported, use the `+` operator to add margin manually. I.e. `popover + popover { margin-top: 1rem }`

#### anchor-positioning

* **Guidance:** Use the [CSS Anchor Positioning Polyfill](https://github.com/oddbird/css-anchor-positioning). For a non-polyfill fallback, default the tooltip to a fixed position at the bottom of the viewport using `@supports not (anchor-name: --foo)`.

#### transition-behavior

* **Guidance:** If transition-behavior is not supported, use JavaScript to add animation via classes as the toast element transitions in and out.
